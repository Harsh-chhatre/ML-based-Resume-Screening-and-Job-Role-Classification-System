# Resume Screening and Job Role Classification System

A machine learning-powered web application that classifies resume text into job categories such as **Data Science**, **HR**, **Web Development**, etc., using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Naive Bayes classifier.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project automates resume screening by analyzing the textual content and predicting the most relevant job role. It uses NLP for text cleaning and feature extraction, and a trained machine learning model to classify resumes. The web interface is built using **Flask**, allowing users to paste resume content and instantly get category predictions.
